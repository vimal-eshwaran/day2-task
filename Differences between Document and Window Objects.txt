Differences between Document and Window Objects

Document Object: 
* It represents any HTML document or web page that is loaded in the browser.
* By accessing the document object, we can access the element in the HTML page
* With the help of document objects, we can add dynamic content to our web page
* The document object can be accessed with a window.document or just document
* It is loaded inside the window
* It is the object of window property.
* All the tags, elements with attributes in HTML are part of the document
* The document is part of BOM (browser object model) and dom (Document object model)
* Properties of document objects such as title, body, cookies, etc can also be accessed by a window like this window. document.title
* example:
     document.title :  will return the title of the document

Window Object: 
* The window object is the topmost object of the DOM hierarchy. 
* It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage. 
* Whenever a window appears on the screen to display the contents of the document, the window object is created. .
* It is the very first object that is loaded in the browser.
* It is the object of the browser.
* Global objects, functions, and variables of JavaScript are members of the window object.
* We can access the window from the window only. i.e. window.window
* The window is part of BOM, not DOM
* Properties of the window object cannot be accessed by the document object.
* example:
window.innerHeight : will return the height of the content area of the browser
